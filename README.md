## hey this is cool but i'm to lazy to update things

Hi im hadi and currently working on several things:

- [Bot Diprat](https://github.com/idahdam/bot-diprat-docs)
- [Personal Homepage](https://github.com/idahdam/personal-homepage)
- [Please, Finish Me!](https://github.com/idahdam/PleaseFinishMe-Repo)
- Things I consider private so don't ask


i consider myself as a person who likes to type on the keyboard. and computer stuff aswell. low level stuff seem challenging to me.
